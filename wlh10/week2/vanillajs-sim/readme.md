# Budget Builder

## Vanilla JS Sim Example

This repo contains a finished example of the Vanilla JS Simulation for DevMountain.

The aim of this project is to push students who finish their week 2 sim early. Students should start this project from scratch utilizing the following files:

```
index.html
style.css
index.js
```

Students should recreate the functionality of Budget Builder using only Vanilla Javascript DOM manipulation.
